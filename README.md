# dk_imagecleaner

This repository contains a shell script that cleans unsed images or images 
that are not associated with a docker container. I often find my pc (company's pc -lol) getting 
slow becasue the docker images I have are consuming resources. so I decided that maybe I ask GPT 先生
to help me conjure up a script that will periodically clean my docker images. so I do not have to do it manually. 

As I create this repository though, I find myself thinking what is the use of sharing this repository? or making it public?
what is the use of sharing open source code when gpt can generate one for you -- much better than the one's we share here lol. 
Such a delema but maybe if someone gets lazy and they just plug and play maybe they can clone my repos and install the script.
I'll write how to setup the scripts below. make I go back to work.
